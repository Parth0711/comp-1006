Our group only consisted of the two of us. Both of us were coders and more importantly we resolved many errors we came across. 
Since we couldn't work on the same file with both computers, we always sat together in order to work on the project.
Since there was a mac and a dell computers, to avoid problems we just worked on the single pc.




Since we could not figure out how to get the remote host to work, we do not have a heroku link.
